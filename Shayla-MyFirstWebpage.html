	<center><p><font color="white">Chipotle had always been a mystery to me since before I ever had it. Everyone around me had always talked about it and how good it was and how it was probably the best place on Earth. I didnt realize this statement was 100% true until I had it for the very first time.</font></p></center></div>

	<center><p><font color="white">When I first started getting Chipotle the contents within were very minimal and it stayed that way for quite a while until I decided to make some serious changes, changes that I am extremly happy that I have made.</font></p></center></div>
<div id="Now" class="tablecontent">
	<center><h3><font color="white">Now</font></h3></center>
	<center><p><font color="white">Now I go to Chipotle very often and i always get a bowl containing steak, white rice, black beans, corn, sour cream, cheese, and lettus. Which is a major upgrade from my original burrito that only consisted of rice, steak, and cheese. </font></p></center></div>
